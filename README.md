# mockupgen templates
A repository of templates for [mockupgen](https://github.com/rmenon1008/mockupgen). 

## About
`mockupgen` is a tool for creating 3D device mockups from a screenshot. The tool downloads templates from this repository when a mockup is requested. `mockupgen` downloads the template index each time it is run, so this repository can be updated independently of the tool.
